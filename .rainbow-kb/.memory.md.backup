> **What belongs here:** Durable facts & decisions that matter weeks/months later.
> **What doesn't:** Day-to-day chat residue (→ daily logs), behavioral rules (→ AGENTS.md), secrets (NEVER).

## Curation Reminder
- **High-signal only:** If it won't matter in 3 months, it doesn't belong here.
- **Facts > Opinions:** Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE (rules → AGENTS.md).
- **Update, don't append:** Keep this file lean—replace outdated info rather than accumulating history.
