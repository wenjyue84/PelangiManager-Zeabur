# Theft & Security Incidents

## When a guest reports theft (e.g. "Someone stole my laptop!")

**Classification:** Always treat as theft/theft_report intent — route to theft_emergency workflow, not unknown or generic complaint.

**Reply requirements:** Every response to a theft report MUST include:
- The word **report** (e.g. "report the incident", "police report")
- At least one of: **security**, **police**, **incident**

**Example phrasing:** "We will help you report the incident and involve security or police if needed."

**Workflow:** Theft goes to theft_emergency workflow. Staff are notified; guest is guided to provide item details, time, and location; we assist with police report and CCTV review.

**Do not** reply with only empathy without mentioning report/security/police/incident.
